AI-Assisted Online Exam Proctoring SystemA Case Study of Technical University of Mombasa This project is a web-based platform designed to enhance academic integrity and reduce examination malpractice in remote learning environments. It utilizes Artificial Intelligence and computer vision to provide a scalable solution for maintaining examination standards.+1📋 Table of ContentsProject OverviewSystem ArchitectureFeaturesTechnical StackDatabase DesignInstallationResearch Context🚀 Project OverviewThe system monitors students during exams using real-time video analysis to detect suspicious behaviors such as multiple faces, frequent head movement, and screen switching. It aims to provide an affordable and transparent alternative to proprietary proctoring solutions.+2🏗 System ArchitectureThe project follows a Three-Tier Architecture:+1Front-end: Interface for students to take exams and for lecturers/admins to manage the system.+1Back-end Server: Manages exam logic, user authentication, and data processing.+1AI Module: Powered by OpenCV for real-time monitoring and face detection.+1✨ FeaturesReal-time Monitoring: Detects candidate presence and identity during the session.Behavior Detection: Identifies suspicious movements and environmental anomalies.Automated Logging: Records violations with timestamps and evidence (images/video).+1Proctoring Reports: Generates detailed summaries of incidents for institutional review.+1Role Management: Distinct functionalities for Students, Lecturers, and System Administrators.🛠 Technical StackProgramming Languages: Python (AI & Logic), JavaScript (Frontend interactions), SQL (Database).+2Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV (Computer Vision), Web-based UI (HTML/CSS/JS).+1Database: MySQL for structured data storage.Development Methodology: Agile, allowing for iterative improvements based on user feedback.🗄 Database DesignThe database is normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity.TablePurposeUsersStores credentials and registration details.ExamsContains exam titles, schedules, and durations.QuestionsStores MCQ, Essay, and True/False questions.Proctoring LogsRecords specific violations and evidence paths.ReportsStores summary metrics and remarks for each exam.⚙️ InstallationClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-proctoring-system.git
Database Setup: Import the provided SQL schema into your MySQL server.AI Module Config: Ensure Python and OpenCV are installed.Hardware Requirements: A functional webcam and stable lighting are required for accurate detection.+1📖 Research ContextAuthor: Brodox George (BSIT/677J/2022) Institution: Technical University of Mombasa Supervisor: Mr. Mwangi Date: January 2026
